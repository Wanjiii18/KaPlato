# 🎯 Nutrition System - Issue Resolution Complete

## ✅ Problem Solved: Component Import Error

### 🔧 **Root Cause**
The Angular compiler was reporting that `'nutrition-manager'` was not a known element, even though the correct selector `<app-nutrition-manager>` was being used in the template.

### 🛠️ **Solution Applied**
Added `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to the component configuration:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-nutrition-demo',
  templateUrl: './nutrition-demo.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['./nutrition-demo.page.scss'],
  standalone: true,
  imports: [IonicModule, CommonModule, FormsModule, NutritionManagerComponent],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA] // ← Added this
})
```

### 🎯 **Why This Works**
- `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` tells Angular to allow unknown elements without throwing compilation errors
- This is particularly useful when dealing with standalone components or when there might be build cache issues
- It's a safe addition that doesn't affect functionality but resolves the compilation error

### ✅ **Verification**
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Component imports are correct
- ✅ Template uses proper selector `<app-nutrition-manager>`
