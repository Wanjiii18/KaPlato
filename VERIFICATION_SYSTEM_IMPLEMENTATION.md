# Karenderia Verification System Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive verification request system to the karenderia settings page, allowing karenderia owners to submit their business documents for admin approval.

## Backend Integration
The system integrates with the existing Laravel backend that has:
- **Status Management**: `pending`, `approved`, `active`, `rejected` status system
- **Admin Endpoint**: `/admin/karenderias/{id}/status` for status updates
- **Karenderia Model**: Fields for `business_permit`, `approved_at`, `approved_by`

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. New Verification Tab
Added a "Verification" tab to the karenderia-settings page with:
- Current verification status display
- File upload interface for required documents
- Status-specific messaging and actions

### 2. Document Upload System
Supports uploading:
- **Business Permit**: Business permit or DTI registration (image/PDF)
- **Business Photos**: 2-5 photos of the karenderia (exterior, interior, kitchen)
- **Owner ID**: Government-issued ID of the business owner (image/PDF)
- **Additional Information**: Optional text field for extra details

### 3. Status Indicators
Visual status cards showing:
- **Not Verified**: Default state, prompts to submit documents
- **Pending Review**: Submitted and awaiting admin review
- **Verified/Active**: Successfully verified by admin
- **Rejected**: Rejected with reason, allows resubmission

### 4. UI Components

#### Status Display
```typescript
interface VerificationStatus = 'pending' | 'approved' | 'active' | 'rejected' | 'not_submitted'
```

#### File Upload Interface
- Drag-and-drop style upload areas
- File preview with remove options
- Visual feedback for upload states
- File type validation (images and PDF)

#### Form Validation
- Ensures all required documents are uploaded
- Requires agreement to terms and conditions
- Prevents submission if requirements not met

### 5. Key Features

#### Dynamic Status Messages
- Status-specific icons (checkmark, clock, error, etc.)
- Contextual descriptions for each status
- Rejection reason display when applicable

#### File Management
- Multiple photo uploads with preview
- Easy file removal interface
- File type and size validation
- Progress indicators during upload

#### Admin Integration Ready
- Form data prepared for backend submission
- Status updates from admin actions
- Notification system integration

### 6. Styling
Comprehensive CSS implementation with:
- Modern card-based layout
- Status-specific color coding
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- File upload styling
- Loading and success states

## Admin Workflow
When implemented with backend:

1. **Owner Submits**: Karenderia owner uploads documents via the verification tab
2. **Admin Notification**: Admin receives notification of pending verification
3. **Admin Review**: Admin reviews documents in admin dashboard
4. **Status Update**: Admin approves/rejects via existing `updateKarenderiaStatus` endpoint
5. **Owner Notification**: Owner sees updated status in their settings

## Backend Endpoints Used
- `PUT /admin/karenderias/{id}/status` - Update verification status
- `GET /admin/karenderias/{id}` - Get karenderia details including status
- `POST /karenderias/{id}/verification` - Submit verification documents (to be implemented)

## Next Steps
1. Implement backend endpoint for verification document submission
2. Add file storage system for uploaded documents
3. Integrate with notification system for status updates
4. Add admin interface for reviewing verification requests
5. Implement email notifications for status changes

## Files Modified
- `karenderia-settings.page.html` - Added verification tab UI
- `karenderia-settings.page.ts` - Added verification logic and file handling
- `karenderia-settings.page.scss` - Added verification styling
- `admin.service.ts` - Already has required methods for status updates

## Security Considerations
- File type validation (images and PDF only)
- File size limits (recommended)
- Secure file storage implementation needed
- Admin authentication for status changes
- Document privacy and access controls

## User Experience
- Clear visual status indicators
- Step-by-step document upload process
- Progress tracking and feedback
- Mobile-responsive interface
- Helpful requirement explanations
